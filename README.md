GLATAR-App 

This is a Shiny App that interfaces with the GLATAR dataabsase to provide a 
seamless and rich interface to interact with the GLATAR database. 

This app has the the ability to upload (i.e., 
if you are a contributing member), map, view raw data (i.e., 
if you are a contributing member), view summarised data, 
and view scatter plots of the raw data.
